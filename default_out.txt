Thanks for installing Rustlings!

Is this your first time?

Let's make sure you're up to speed:
- You have Rust installed, preferably via `rustup`
- You have `~/.cargo/bin` added to your PATH variable
- You have cloned this repository (https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
- You have installed Rust language support for your editor

If you've done all of this (or even most of it), congrats! You're ready
to start working with Rust.

To get started, run `cargo run watch` in order to get the first exercise.
Make sure to have your editor open!
